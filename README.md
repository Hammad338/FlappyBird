## Flappy Bird

A Unity-based clone of the classic game **Flappy Bird**, where the player controls a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes by tapping or pressing a key to stay airborne. This project was built as a learning experience for Unity development and game mechanics.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- The objective is to navigate the bird through an endless series of pipes.
- The player scores a point for each pipe successfully passed.
- The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.

## 🚀 Features

- **Smooth gameplay mechanics**: Replicates the classic Flappy Bird physics.
- **Dynamic pipe generation**: Pipes are spawned procedurally to ensure a unique experience every time.
- **Score Counter**: Real-time score tracking displayed on the UI.
